This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java, where a loop attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index. The code uses a for loop to iterate through an array and assigns each element a value. However, the loop condition `i <= arr.length` is incorrect and leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution shows how to correct this by changing the condition to `i < arr.length`.
